    <p><h2>About Me:</h2>
Witness to the continuous and ever-increasing environmental destruction around, I find solace in documenting the local birds, butterflies, moths and other insects wherever I live. I travel but very little. Now well adapted to a minimalistic way of life, I try to take little from the earth just like one of my favorite birds: the Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus. A preference for walking over any other mode of transport, if possible, is one example. Not watching television is another (I never purchased a TV). 
I am an engineer by education, training and profession with an MBA. I last worked as a General Manager in a 660 MW thermal power project built and operated by the largest power producing company of India. 
I completed my Diploma in Creative Writing in English with the final project titled “Mother Earth”. The project comprised of a series of articles with emphasis on ways to reconnect to the world of nature. Educating people about the deep connections between various ecological processes and how human greed is disrupting these very processes, is my preferred way of spreading the message of conservation. 
A trained mountaineer, I occasionally visit the Himalaya for much cherished long treks.
